I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
Isn't that something to be proud of, Tom?
We've decided to give you the loan you requested.
Don't bother yourself.
I don't think Tom is going to want to go to Boston with you.
Diana, you might take Anne out into the garden and show her your flowers.
Go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess.
Marilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no use; she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and unusual peal of laughter that Matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted in amazement.
I was just a little kid then.
I shaved.
I felt fine.
I can't work today.
I am learning Kazakh.
Our table is wobbling. Give me your art book so I can make it stay still.
Tom never does anything unless he has to.
How can people be so dumb?
You're here early today.
I brought her chocolate.
Don't complain so much.
I'm not used to such compliments.
She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy, with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a seraph.
I quite frankly don't know.
I'm not going to sing today.
I was already leaving.
My life turned into a dark and shapeless living hell.
How did you get to do that?
I thought Tom wasn't coming.
In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his coffin, his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little kindly smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams.

Did you show those photos to your friends?
How can you do this to a kid?

Tom will definitely not do that.
Tom's band was really good tonight.
How can you watch a movie without popcorn?
We've had a lot of opportunities.

Why do you know so much about Tom?
Tom stayed home with the children.
Tom and Mary used to live in the house that John and Alice live in now.
I shut the door.
I used to be the manager.
I think things are getting better.
People Tom's age don't make new friends easily.
How much water do you drink a day?
Tom has got nobody to look after him but me.
I didn't buy it.
That wasn't what I expected.
I thought you liked Tom better than John.
I'm so glad I met you.
We can't give you anything.
Did Tom come to the party with anyone?
How often do you use your telephone?
I was the star.
I've been dealing with major back pain.
I lived there for a few years.

I hope I'll fit in.
That might be dangerous.

I'm not homeless.
Was I supposed to sing?
I don't have to be nice to you.
How did you know where to look for that?
We might not do that.
I'll do whatever it takes to protect my children.
I can't see any need to do that.
That's not worth the price they're asking for.
I don't think there's any way I can get there on time.
I'm a paramedic.
Now's my chance.
Tom has something very important to tell you.
It was not my idea.
Dania was a hopeless romantic that easily fell in love with men.
I understood for the first time in my life what falling deeply in love was.
I braced myself.
I'm a bus driver.
I'm grown up now.
I'm still unsure.
I'm probably the only one here who knows how to do that.

It took several years, but they finally had children.
There was blood everywhere in Fadil's house.
Fadil would have been dead ten minutes later.
Fadil was still battling cancer.
"Did you see that movie?" "Yes."
Fadil actually thought he could get away with that.

Tom was getting used to TV.
Fadil improved his fluency in Arabic very quickly.
Fadil knew Layla had been wronged.
I can't believe Fadil did this to me.
She has no idea what she's talking about.

She was abandoned.
Who convinced Tom to do that?
Layla was a charming woman.
I'm not pleased.
Nobody knew it was Tom who donated three million dollars to the orphanage.

You're a talented kid.
I'll probably do that.
You still look tired.
Sami depended on Layla to take care of him.
My disease will kill me.

Tom is not likely to do that.
We never opened that window.
I was probably right.
I slid down the pole.
I can't do that without Tom.
Tom is in Boston, isn't he?
You never seem satisfied.
Tom gave me three apples.
I slid the window shut.
You look freaked out.
I just got this suit.
Have a good rest!
She stole it.

I always thought Tom was so cool.
We've been planning this for over a year now.
Tom realized he was in love with Mary.
I never had doubts.
Your parents raised you well.
I'm not a smart man.
It's really cloudy here.
This book seems very interesting.
Yet we live.
